#For this assignment, you need to modify the program you created in the User Input Assignment so that it can take up to 5 employees' worth of information. Also, when a user enters improper data, the program asks the user to re-enter it before continuing on.
#As employee information is added, create a list of dictionaries that hold all of the information. And the end of your program, print out the list.
#Be sure to put comments in your code that clearly mark how you are performing your program logic. Also, be sure to apply the lessons about structuring dictionaries that were covered in the lecture.


#    •	1 file containing the "Try it Yourself" exercises from Chapter 7 in your textbook. You may skip exercise 7-7. Please add comments in your code so I can clearly see where you are attempting each exercise.
#    •	1 file containing the example code we worked through in the "Working with Dictionaries" demo video in the module.
#    •	1 file containing the example code we worked through in the "Gathering User Input Demonstration" demo video in the module.
#    •	1 file containing the example code we worked through in the "Working with While Loops" demo video in the module.
#    Simply place everything into a ZIP file and upload it to this assignment.
#    Do not, under any circumstances, share your homework with another student so they can just copy and submit it. Not only are you short-circuiting someone else's learning process(which guarantees they will not be successful when concepts get more difficult), but this is academic misconduct, and both parties will be referred to the Academic Conduct Committee accordingly.
